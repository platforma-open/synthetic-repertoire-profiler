Make nucleotide-level export opt-in via a single "Export nucleotide-level results" checkbox (off by default).

Replaces the previous "Produce nucleotide-level state matrix" toggle (`ntStateMatrix`, migrated forward to `exportNt`). When enabled, the workflow now computes AND exports the nt state matrix (previously the flag computed it but nothing was ever saved), plus every other nt-related column in the exported `variants` frame: nt variants and sequences, per-sample nt abundance, parent→nt and nt↔aa linkers, and the nt known-set overlay. When off (default), only amino-acid-level columns are exported.

Behavior change: downstream blocks no longer receive nucleotide-level columns unless the checkbox is enabled. The block's own Known Variants (NT) / Unmatched (NT) tables are unaffected — they remain driven by the uploaded known-nt set.

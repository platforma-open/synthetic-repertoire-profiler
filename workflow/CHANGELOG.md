## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 45043de: Add an "Export only known variants" option to the Known Variants section. It is off by default and shown whenever a known set (nucleotide and/or amino-acid) is supplied. When enabled, the exported variant repertoire is restricted to variants that matched a known entry — nucleotide variants with `assignStatus == ASSIGNED`, amino-acid variants carrying a `knownAaKey`. The filter applies across the whole exported `variants` frame (per-sample abundance, per-variant properties, state matrices, linkers, and distance-to-known columns); read counts and fractions keep their original basis (fraction of all reads), unmatched rows are simply dropped. A level with no match signal (e.g. nucleotide when only an amino-acid set is given) exports empty. The block-local Known Variants / Unmatched tables and the QC report are unaffected — they always reflect the full analysis.

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 21fab8d: Add an amino-acid mutation-load filter (count + fraction), mirroring the existing
  nucleotide filter. Feeds mitool's call-mutations step via
  `-Mcall-mutations.maxAaMutations` / `-Mcall-mutations.maxAaMutationFraction`;
  drops in-frame variants whose translated sequence diverges from the parent by more
  than the configured amino-acid edit count / fraction. Empty = off (default).

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- fbe3553: Add whole-dataset "Auto-detect VDJ regions (germline)" option. When enabled, the workflow
  infers every parent's FR1–FR4 boundaries from germline (repseqio, reusing the
  mixcr-amplicon-alignment flow) and builds the `--parent-regions` overlay automatically,
  instead of the user entering region lengths by hand. Parents must be in-frame V-domains;
  detection fails per-parent with a clear message otherwise.

## 1.0.4

### Patch Changes

- a91eb74: Align column labels with other block. The variant display-id column is now "Variant Id" (was "Variant") and the known-set display id is "Known Variant Id"; shared abundance columns adopt the reference wording: "Supporting Reads", "Mean Fraction of Reads", "Number of Reads", "Number of Samples". The per-variant mutation-count column is now labeled "Nt mutations" / "AA mutations" (was "Mutation count"), matching the reference's Nt/AA alphabet-prefix convention. Alphabet markers on sequence-style columns and key axes now use the reference's " aa" / " nt" suffix (e.g. "CDR3 aa", "Variant nt") instead of the parenthesized "(aa)" / "(nt)" form.

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- c4c61c4: Add an optional per-fragment mutation-load filter to Advanced Settings: "Max mutations" and "Max mutation fraction".

  Both are off by default. When set, they are passed to mitool's align step (`-Malign.filter.maxMutations` / `-Malign.filter.maxMutationFraction`), rejecting an alignment that exceeds the cap as a likely misalignment / off-target read. The two gates are applied independently.

  Also fix the Alignments chart in the sample report: the not-aligned reasons now use the correct mitool codes (`NoAlignment`, `IncompleteParentCoverage`, `TooManyMutations`, `LowBaseQuality`, `NoInput`), each with a human-readable label and a distinct color. Previously the stale label map matched no real code, so every reason showed its raw code in a single fallback color.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- f57f858: Make nucleotide-level export opt-in via a single "Export nucleotide-level results" checkbox (off by default).

  Replaces the previous "Produce nucleotide-level state matrix" toggle (`ntStateMatrix`, migrated forward to `exportNt`). When enabled, the workflow now computes AND exports the nt state matrix (previously the flag computed it but nothing was ever saved), plus every other nt-related column in the exported `variants` frame: nt variants and sequences, per-sample nt abundance, parent→nt and nt↔aa linkers, and the nt known-set overlay. When off (default), only amino-acid-level columns are exported.

  Behavior change: downstream blocks no longer receive nucleotide-level columns unless the checkbox is enabled. The block's own Known Variants (NT) / Unmatched (NT) tables are unaffected — they remain driven by the uploaded known-nt set.

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- c4c61c4: Add an optional per-fragment mutation-load filter to Advanced Settings: "Max mutations" and "Max mutation fraction".

  Both are off by default. When set, they are passed to mitool's align step (`-Malign.filter.maxMutations` / `-Malign.filter.maxMutationFraction`), rejecting an alignment that exceeds the cap as a likely misalignment / off-target read. The two gates are applied independently.

  Also fix the Alignments chart in the sample report: the not-aligned reasons now use the correct mitool codes (`NoAlignment`, `IncompleteParentCoverage`, `TooManyMutations`, `LowBaseQuality`, `NoInput`), each with a human-readable label and a distinct color. Previously the stale label map matched no real code, so every reason showed its raw code in a single fallback color.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- f57f858: Make nucleotide-level export opt-in via a single "Export nucleotide-level results" checkbox (off by default).

  Replaces the previous "Produce nucleotide-level state matrix" toggle (`ntStateMatrix`, migrated forward to `exportNt`). When enabled, the workflow now computes AND exports the nt state matrix (previously the flag computed it but nothing was ever saved), plus every other nt-related column in the exported `variants` frame: nt variants and sequences, per-sample nt abundance, parent→nt and nt↔aa linkers, and the nt known-set overlay. When off (default), only amino-acid-level columns are exported.

  Behavior change: downstream blocks no longer receive nucleotide-level columns unless the checkbox is enabled. The block's own Known Variants (NT) / Unmatched (NT) tables are unaffected — they remain driven by the uploaded known-nt set.
